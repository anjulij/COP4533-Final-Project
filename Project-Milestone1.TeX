\section*{Milestone 1: Understanding the Problem}
\subsection*{Problem 1}

\noindent \textbf{Step 1.} Input matrix A
$$A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    12 & 1 & 5 & 3 & 16 \\
    4 & 4 & 13 & 4 & 9 \\
    6 & 8 & 6 & 1 & 2 \\
    14 & 3 & 4 & 8 & 10 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Step 2.} Potential profit by selling on each day for each stock.

\medskip
Let $p_{i,j}$ be the potential profit of selling stock $i$ on day $j$. Then,
\begin{itemize}
	\item $p_{1,1} = 0$, $p_{1,2} = 0$, $p_{1,3} = 4$, $p_{1,4} = 2$, $p_{1,5} = 15$
	\item $p_{2,1} = 0$, $p_{2,2} = 0$, $p_{2,3} = 9$, $p_{2,4} = 0$, $p_{2,5} = 5$
	\item $p_{3,1} = 0$, $p_{3,2} = 2$, $p_{3,3} = 0$, $p_{3,4} = 0$, $p_{3,5} = 1$
	\item $p_{4,1} = 0$, $p_{4,2} = 0$, $p_{4,3} = 1$, $p_{4,4} = 5$, $p_{4,5} = 7$
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Step 3.} Identify the day with the highest potential profit for each stock.

\medskip
Based on the calculated values for $p_{i,j}$ in the previous step,
\begin{itemize}
    \item $max_{j}p_{1,j} = 15$, on day $5$
    \item $max_{j}p_{2,j} = 9$, on day $3$
    \item $max_{j}p_{3,j} = 2$, on day $2$
    \item $max_{j}p_{4,j} = 7$, on day $5$
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Step 4.} Determine the stock and day combination that yields the maximum potential profit.

\medskip
Based on step 3, the maximum potential profit is $15$ and is obtained by selling the first stock on the fifth day. The stock would be bought on the second day, therefore the output for this example would be
$$(1, 2, 5, 15)$$

\subsection*{Problem 2}
You are given a matrix A of dimensions $m \times n$, where each element represents the predicted prices of m different stocks for n consecutive days. Additionally, you are given an integer $k (1 \leq k \leq n)$. Your task is to find a sequence of at most k transactions, each involving the purchase and sale of a single stock, that yields the maximum profit.

\subsubsection*{Input:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A matrix A of dimensions $m \times n (1 \leq m, n \leq 1000)$, where each element $A[i][j] (0 \leq A[i][j] \leq 105)$ represents the predicted price of the i-th stock on the j-th day.
    \item An integer $k (1 \leq k \leq n)$ representing the maximum number of transactions allowed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Output:}
Return a sequence of tuples $(i, j_1, j_2)$ representing the transactions where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  $i (1 \leq i \leq m)$ is the index of the chosen stock.
    \item  $j_1 (1 \leq j_1 \leq n)$ is the day when you would buy the stock to maximize profit in this transaction.
    \item $j_2 (1 \leq j_2 \leq n)$ is the day when you would sell the stock to maximize profit in this transaction.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Contstraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can perform at most k transactions, each involving the purchase and sale of a single stock.
    \item You must buy before selling; in other words, $j_1$ must be less than $j_2$.
    \item The prices are non-negative integers and represent the stock’s value at a specific time.
    \item You want to maximize profit, so you’re looking for the highest possible difference between the sell price and the buy price.
    \item If no profitable transaction is possible, return an empty sequence. If there are multiples sequences achieving the same optimal profit, return any one of them.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Input Matrix A}

\[
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
    25 & 30 & 15 & 40 & 50 \\
    10 & 20 & 30 & 25 & 5\\
    30 & 45 & 35 & 10 & 15\\
    5 & 50 & 35 & 25 & 45
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[k = 3\]

\paragraph{Step 1.} Begin with the input matrix A as provided.

\medskip
\noindent We start with 4 stocks, 5 days, and a maximum of 3 transactions that cannot overlap. 

\paragraph{Step 2.} Identify maximum profits for each stock

\noindent This step can be completed by iterating through each row and creating a list of maximum profits for each stock

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Step 3.} Output should be a sequence of at most k transactions in the format of $(i,j,l)$ that yields the maximum potential profit by selling ith stock on lth day that was bought on jth day.

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using a greedy approach we start with our largest profit: Buy $[Stock_4, Day_1] = 5$, Sell $[Stock_4, Day_2] = 50$, profit = 45. (4,1,2)
    \item We then find our next largest non-overlapping profit by eliminating all options that include Day 1 as the buying day. Buy $[Stock_1, Day_3] = 15$, Sell $[Stock_1, Day_5] = 50$, profit = 35. (1, 3, 5)
    \item We then find our third and last largest non-overlapping profit by eliminating all options that including day 1 and 3 as the buying day and Stock 4 and 1. Buy $[Stock_2, Day_2] = 20$, Sell $[Stock_2, Day_3] = 30$, profit = 10. (2, 2, 3) 
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent This yields a maximum profit of 90

\subsection*{Problem 3}
\[
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
    7 & 1 & 5 & 3 & 6 & 8 & 9 \\
    2 & 4 & 3 & 7 & 9 & 1 & 8 \\
    5 & 8 & 9 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 10 \\
    9 & 3 & 4 & 8 & 7 & 4 & 1 \\
    3 & 1 & 5 & 8 & 9 & 6 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[c = 2\]
\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Step 1.}  Begin with the input matrix A and integer c as provided

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Step 2.} For each day $j$, identify the maximum price to sell the stock $\ell$. 
You can only buy another stock after $c + 1$ days (i.e., on day $\ell + c + 1$ or later).

\medskip
Let $i$ = stock number; $j$ = buy day; $\ell$ = sale day.

\medskip
\textbf{1 Buy 1 Sell Combinations}

\[
\begin{aligned}
(1,2,7) &:\quad profit = 8 \\
(2,6,7) &:\quad profit = 7 \\
(3,4,7) &:\quad profit = 9 \\
(4,2,4) &:\quad profit = 5 \\
(5,2,5) &:\quad profit = 8 \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}
\]

\medskip
\textbf{2 Buy 2 Sell Combinations}

\[
\begin{aligned}
(1,1,2), (1,5,7) &:\quad profit = -3 \\
(2,1,2), (2,6,7) &:\quad profit = 5 \\
(3,1,2), (3,5,7) &:\quad profit = 11 \\
(4,1,2), (4,6,7) &:\quad profit = -9 \\
(5,1,2), (5,6,7) &:\quad profit = -4 \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
(1,2,3), (1,6,7) &:\quad profit = 5 \\
(2,1,3), (2,6,7) &:\quad profit = 8 \\
(3,1,3), (3,6,7) &:\quad profit = 11 \\
(4,2,3), (4,6,7) &:\quad profit = -2 \\
(5,2,3), (5,6,7) &:\quad profit = 2 \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}
\]

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Step 3.} Determine the sequence (i,j,l) that yields the maximum potential profit by selling ith stock on lth day that was bought on jth day.

\medskip
Maximum profit found is 11. Therefore, the sequences that yields the maximum potential profit are
\[
\left[(3,1,3),(3,6,7)\right]
\quad \text{and} \quad
\left[(3,1,2),(3,5,7)\right].
\]
