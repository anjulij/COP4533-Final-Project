\section*{Milestone 1: Understanding the Problem}
\subsection*{Problem 1}

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Work out the given numerical example for Problem-2. That is, You are given a matrix A of dimensions $ \times n$, where each element represents the predicted prices of m different stocks for n consecutive days. Additionally, you are given an integer $k (1 \leq k \leq n)$. Your task is to manually find a sequence of at most $k$ transactions, each involving the purchase and sale of a single stock, that yields the maximum profit. (Refer to problem statement - 2 for output format).

\paragraph{Input Matrix A}

\[
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
    25 & 30 & 15 & 40 & 50 \\
    10 & 20 & 30 & 25 & 5\\
    30 & 45 & 35 & 10 & 15\\
    5 & 50 & 35 & 25 & 45
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[k = 3\]

\paragraph{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Begin with the input matrix A as provided.
    \item Determine the sequence of at-most K non-overlapping transactions. A valid transaction is a buy-sell of the same stock. Different transactions can have different stocks, but one transaction would deal with only a single stock.
    \item Output should be a sequence of at most K transactions in the format of $(i,j,l)$ that yields the maximum potential profit by selling ith stock on lth day that was bought on jth day.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This milestone involves manually applying the basic logic of calculating potential profits and selecting the optimal transaction for a single stock.
\item The goal is to understand the foundational logic of finding the maximum profit for atmost K non-overlapping transactions by considering the price differences between different days for a specific
stock (in a single transaction).
\end{itemize}
